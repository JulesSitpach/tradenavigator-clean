# TradeNavigator - Frontend-only Deployment

This is a simplified deployment of the TradeNavigator application. The frontend is deployed to Netlify, while the backend functionality is simulated with mock data.

## Deployment Setup

- **Frontend**: React with Vite, deployed to Netlify
- **Backend**: Mocked API responses for demonstration purposes

## Frontend Features

- Cost analysis
- Route analysis
- Tariff analysis
- Dashboard overview
- User authentication (simulated)

## Development vs Production

- In development: Connects to a real backend API
- In production: Uses mock data to simulate backend responses

## Next Steps

For a full deployment with a real backend:

1. Deploy the backend to a service like Render, Railway, or Heroku
2. Update the API client to connect to the deployed backend
3. Configure environment variables for API endpoints
