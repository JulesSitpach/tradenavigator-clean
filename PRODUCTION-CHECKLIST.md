# TradeNavigator - Path to Production Readiness

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan to bring TradeNavigator from its current beta state to a production-ready application suitable for consumer use. Each task includes an estimated difficulty and priority level to help focus efforts.

## Current Status: BETA QUALITY
TradeNavigator is currently in a working beta state with core functionality implemented, but requires refinement before being considered fully production-ready for consumers.
